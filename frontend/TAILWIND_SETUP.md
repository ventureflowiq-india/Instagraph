# Tailwind CSS Setup

Tailwind CSS 3 has been successfully installed and configured in this React project.

## What was installed:

- `tailwindcss` - The main Tailwind CSS framework
- `postcss` - CSS processor required by Tailwind
- `autoprefixer` - Automatically adds vendor prefixes to CSS

## Configuration files created:

- `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind configuration file
- `postcss.config.js` - PostCSS configuration file

## CSS setup:

The Tailwind directives have been added to `src/index.css`:
```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

## Usage:

You can now use Tailwind CSS classes in your React components. For example:

```jsx
<div className="bg-blue-500 text-white p-4 rounded-lg">
  <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold">Hello Tailwind!</h1>
</div>
```

## Testing:

A test component has been added to `App.tsx` to verify that Tailwind CSS is working correctly. You should see a blue box with white text when you run the development server.

## Development server:

Run `npm start` to start the development server and see Tailwind CSS in action.
